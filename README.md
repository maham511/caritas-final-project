## Project Brief

### Business problem
At Caritas, we work on a number of projects to help those across the Diocese of Salford experience poverty, disadvantage and discrimination to transform their lives with dignity. This specific project focuses on the Caritas Refugee Eductaion project. Caritas
Refugee Education works alongside refugees and asylum seekers in order to assist in their journey of wellbeing and integration through language lessons, community, mentoring into further education and employment, and wrap-around well-being services.

Caritas Refugee Education [web page](https://www.caritassalford.org.uk/service-view/caritas-refugee-education-2/) needs some work.


### Proposed functionality
The web page should be self-contained, and shouldn't be very large.
It's a public page and shouldn't have any personal data, but should have learners' testimony. The page should have information about the services offered and can act almost like a blog. 

### Users and roles
As a host, I want to have a website that is easy for learners to navigate, that describes the services offered.

### Likely challenges
- Be careful how you structure your data as this could get confusing quickly
- A clean design


## Crucial Run Commands

### `npm run dev`

Run the project locally with live reload in development mode.

### `npm run build`

Run a production build into `./public`. The result is ready to be put on any static hosting you prefer.
